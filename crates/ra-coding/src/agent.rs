//! Construction of the coding agent's declaration.
//!
//! This is where the assembled prompt meets the agent, and it is the only place the two can meet.
//! `AgentSpec` lives in the kernel and takes instructions as text; the assembler lives in a service
//! crate the kernel cannot see. Whoever builds the agent is therefore the one component able to
//! ensure the text in `system_instructions` is an assembled prefix rather than an unstructured
//! string — with a known section order, a prefix hash, and a dump the review process can diff.
